TODO:
-read through the rest of the tutorial
-get to custom shaders. understand how to load geometry
-vert shader goal: see if we can get to basic shader animation with lots and lots of triangles
-frag shader goal: lambert shading with time varying ambient
-camera moves with click // http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18584389/listen-to-mouse-hold-event-on-website

-awesome if we can get three shader sets working:
	-basic transform and lambert -> for building on
	-grass
	-sky


RESOURCES, ART, NUMBERS, ETC.

-average 40,000 blades of grass per square foot, ~5 million blades in a 12x12 area
-if we make it taller, what can we get away with? hopefully a lot less
-let's try to get up to 1 million blades at once
-each will be 5 triangles, two quads and a pointy thing at the top, 5 vertices
-so 5 million triangles (!!)
